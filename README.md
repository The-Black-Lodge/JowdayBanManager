## Read first!
Suggested steps for using BanManager:
1. Before starting your run, create your ban list by unchecking boons you don't want to see.
2. Save your profile.
3. Begin a new run.
4. Load your profile.

## About the checkboxes
- Checkbox changes are applied immediately!
- Creating a Profile is not necessary if you just want to experiment with the checkboxes.

## A few notes on Profiles
- Profiles do NOT load automatically!
- Profiles are saved to your save slot.
- Profiles can be reused.
- Deleting a Profile does NOT wipe out your current bans.

### Saving a profile
Open up the "Create or Update Profiles" section: \
![profiles](https://github.com/The-Black-Lodge/JowdayBanManager/assets/7319207/c812cc4e-acb8-4c5e-b72e-40774954fd50) \
Give your profile a name and optional description, and save! This can also be used to update a profile you have loaded.

### Loading a profile
Open your profile in the "Saved Profiles" section: \
![loading](https://github.com/The-Black-Lodge/JowdayBanManager/assets/7319207/65e4b24b-84b5-4560-b13b-741ccf497229) \
From here, you can load your profile into your current run, or delete it.
